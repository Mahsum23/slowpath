# slowpath — Learning App Design Doc

**Status:** v2 built (2026-09-02) — cloud sync + mentor chat (Gemini free tier or
Claude). Code in `app/`, how-to in `app/README.md`.
**Type:** installable PWA (Progressive Web App) — runs in the browser, "Add to Home
Screen" on iPhone gives it a full-screen icon, offline support, and a native-ish feel.
No Mac, Xcode, App Store, or developer account required.

> **On "I want an iOS app":** asked and answered — there's no Mac, so native SwiftUI
> was never actually on the table (no Xcode, no simulator, no signing, and nothing on
> the Linux box could even compile it). React Native and Capacitor both hit the same
> wall for a permanent install. The PWA is the only path that produces a real
> home-screen app on that hardware, and on iOS it genuinely gets full-screen launch,
> offline, and its own icon. What it does not get: the App Store, and storage iOS
> promises to keep — hence the export in §3.5, which is load-bearing rather than nice
> to have.

**Owner of content:** this repo. The app is a *delivery vehicle* for the C++
curriculum in `milestones/` — it does not contain the learning; it presents it.

## 1. Purpose & principles

One-line goal: **open your phone, land on today's C++ session, finish it in 20–30
minutes, keep the streak.** Zero friction, no "what should I do today" tax.

Principles, in priority order:

1. **Zero-friction start.** App opens directly to today's session with one primary
   button. No menus to navigate to begin.
2. **One session = one day.** The daily unit is Theory → Quiz → Task, sized to
   ~20–30 min. The app never pressures more than one session a day — the goal is
   consistency, not grinding.
3. **The mentor's voice.** Copy throughout uses the mentor persona from `CLAUDE.md`:
   opinionated, a little informal, precise on the technical bits, real trivia. Not a
   childish gamified toy, not a dry textbook.
4. **Offline-first.** Loaded weeks work with no network (metro, plane). Network is
   only needed to *fetch new weeks* and (v2) to chat.
5. **No dark patterns.** Streaks and XP motivate; they never guilt-trip or
   manufacture urgency. A missed day is a missed day, not a crisis.
6. **Honest about what it is.** The in-app mentor is Claude, presented as Claude. No
   pretending to be a human tutor.

---

## 2. Division of labor: app vs. Claude Code sessions

These two coexist and do different jobs. Worth being explicit so we don't duplicate.

| | **The app (phone, solo, daily)** | **Claude Code (laptop, this repo)** |
|---|---|---|
| Theory | Read the day's lesson | Ask deeper "why" follow-ups live |
| Quiz | Self-contained, instant feedback | (n/a — app owns this) |
| Task | Read the spec, jot notes, mark done | **Write the actual C++ here** |
| Code review | — | Senior-style review of your code |
| Teach-back | Graded conversation, step 4 of every session | Examiner prompt probes the answer, then rules solid/gaps |
| Chat (v2) | Quick mentor questions in-context | Full mentoring, code, debugging |

The app is the **daily driver and reference**; the laptop repo is where real code and
real review happen. The app's Task screen is a *briefing*, not an IDE — you still open
the laptop to write `server.cpp`.

---

## 3. Screens & flows

Six screens. Wireframes are rough — they're about layout and hierarchy, not final
pixels.

### 3.1 Today (home / launch screen)

The default screen. Answers "what am I doing right now" in under a second.

```

```

- The button reads **Start** for a fresh day, **Continue** if the day is partway done,
  **Done today ✓ — see you tomorrow** once complete (with a soft option to peek ahead
  or review a past day).
- Streak flame top-left. Tapping it goes to Stats.

### 3.2 Session player (the core flow)

A three-step stepper: **Theory → Quiz → Task**. One step per screen, a progress bar
pinned to the top showing position in the day. This is the "current lesson menu" —
linear by default, because a daily learner shouldn't have to decide what's next.

**Quiz step** — one question per card, mirrors the multiple-choice style already used
in Claude Code sessions. Wrong options are *real misconceptions*. After you answer:
the choice turns green/red, and a **"why"** explanation expands for both the right
answer and the wrong one you might have picked.

**Task step** — the day's coding brief. Description, target file(s), the exact compile

honest third column of `PROGRESS.md`. Buttons: **Mark attempted** / **Mark done**.

Finishing the Task completes the day → confetti-lite celebration, streak/XP update,
back to Today.

### 3.3 Week map (the path)

> Superseded by §8.8: the map is now one path per track with topic dividers, and nothing
> is loaded by hand.

The whole week as a vertical path — done / current / locked. Lets you jump back to a
finished day to re-read or re-drill its quiz (spaced repetition). Days ahead are
locked to preserve the one-a-day rhythm (unlockable via a small "peek ahead" if you
insist — no nanny state, just a gentle default).

```
┌─────────────────────────────┐

└─────────────────────────────┘
```

### 3.4 Stats / progress

Streak, total days done, XP, badges, and a small honesty panel: "days you flagged as
confusing" so the app reflects the real struggle, not just green checkmarks.

Badges (examples): First Socket (Day 1), Byte-Order Boss (Day 2), Week 1 Complete,
7-Day Streak, Milestone 01 Reviewed, Teach-back Passed. Earned in the mentor's voice,
not "You're a superstar!!!" filler.

### 3.5 Settings

Theme (system / light / dark), reset progress, export/import progress JSON (backup,
since it's a single device), and — greyed until v2 — **Anthropic API key** for chat.

### 3.6 Mentor chat — see §8. Built.

---

## 4. Gamification & motivation (tasteful, evidence-based)

Pulled from what actually works in Duolingo/Brilliant/etc., minus the manipulative
parts:

- **Streak** — daily. One session keeps it alive. Optional single "streak freeze" you
  earn (not buy) every 7 days, so one busy day doesn't nuke a month of work. No paid
  freezes, no panic notifications.
- **Day progress ring** — 3 segments (Theory/Quiz/Task). Visible, satisfying to close.
- **Week progress bar** — the medium horizon.
- **XP** — small amount per completed session, a bit more for a clean quiz sweep.
  XP is flavor/feedback, not a currency for anything.
- **Badges/milestones** — punctuate real achievements (a milestone done, a streak, a
  teach-back passed), in the mentor voice.
- **Spaced repetition** — finished days' quizzes are re-offerable from the map; the
  app can surface a "quick review" of an earlier day's quiz occasionally. Retention >
  novelty.
- **Daily goal = 1 session.** Explicitly capped ambition. The win condition is
  *showing up*, matching the 20–30 min/day reality.

Deliberately **excluded**: leaderboards (single user), guilt notifications, streak
loss shaming, anything that turns a bad week into a reason to quit.

---

## 5. Visual design

- **UI font:** the system stack (`-apple-system`), which on iPhone renders as **SF
  Pro** — native, gorgeous, zero download, perfectly at home on the device. Falls back
  to Inter/Segoe elsewhere.
- **Code font:** **JetBrains Mono** (bundled `.woff2` for offline). Ligatures make C++
  operators (`->`, `::`, `<=`, `>>`) read cleanly. This is a C++ app; code typography
  is not optional.
- **Optional display face:** one characterful face for big numbers (streak, XP) only —
  everything else stays SF Pro. Kept restrained.
- **Color:** dark-mode-first (it's for developers), full light mode too, honoring
  `prefers-color-scheme` plus a manual toggle. Calm base, one confident accent for
  primary actions and the streak flame. Semantic green/red only for quiz correctness.
- **Code highlighting:** proper C++ syntax highlighting in theory blocks (bundled
  highlighter, offline). Non-negotiable — unhighlighted C is hostile to read on a
  phone.
- **Motion:** restrained. A progress ring closing, a gentle completion celebration.
  No bouncing mascots.
- **Layout:** card-based, generous spacing, one primary action per screen, thumb-
  reachable buttons (bottom-anchored CTAs).

---

## 6. Content data model

The contract between the curriculum (repo) and the app. Two JSON shapes.

### 6.1 Curriculum manifest — `content/curriculum.json`

The index the app checks for what weeks exist.

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "title": "slowpath",
  "weeks": [
    {
      "id": "week-01",
      "title": "Raw Sockets I",
      "milestone": "01-raw-sockets",
      "days": 7,
      "url": "content/weeks/week-01.json",
      "contentHash": "sha256:…",
      "available": true
    }
  ]
}
```

### 6.2 Week — `content/weeks/week-01.json`

> Superseded by §8.8: one of these per track (`track-sql.json`), same shape plus `topics`
> and `next`.

```json
{
  "id": "week-01",
  "title": "Raw Sockets I",
  "milestone": "01-raw-sockets",
  "intro": "The layer underneath the libraries you already use. Build the black box first…",
  "days": [
    {
      "id": "day-01",
      "day": 1,
      "title": "A socket is a file descriptor",
      "estMinutes": 25,
      "theoryMarkdown": "## What a socket actually is …",
      "quiz": [
        {
          "id": "q1",
          "prompt": "What does socket() returning -1 vs 3 mean?",
          "options": [
            { "text": "-1 = failure, check errno", "correct": true,
              "why": "Sentinel-return + errno is the universal POSIX pattern." },
            { "text": "-1 = no client yet", "correct": false,
              "why": "socket() hasn't touched the network; it can't know about clients." }
          ]
        }
      ],
      "task": {
        "markdown": "Call socket(), check it, print the fd, close() it.",
        "files": ["src/main.cpp"],
        "compile": "g++ -std=c++20 -Wall -Wextra -o day1 src/main.cpp",
        "checklist": ["socket() return checked", "close() called", "zero warnings"]
      },
      "teachBack": null
    }
  ]
}
```

The quiz `options[].correct/why` maps exactly to how quizzes already run in Claude
Code sessions (real misconceptions as distractors, explain why each is wrong).

### 6.3 Authoring pipeline (single source of truth)

Problem: the theory/task should stay human-readable in the repo (`milestones/*/lessons/
day-NN-*.md`), but the quiz **answer keys** shouldn't sit in the obvious file the
learner might open.

**Recommended approach:** author two files per day, compiled into the week JSON by a
small build script:

- `milestones/<m>/lessons/day-NN-<slug>.md` — theory + task, greppable, no answer keys
  (quiz shows question text only, as today).
- `milestones/<m>/lessons/day-NN-<slug>.quiz.yaml` — the quiz answer key (options,
  `correct`, `why`).

A script (`app/scripts/build-content.mjs`) parses both, emits
`content/weeks/week-NN.json` + updates `curriculum.json` with a fresh `contentHash`.
So the repo stays the single source of truth; the app JSON is a build artifact, never
hand-edited. Alternative considered — one JSON per day as source, generate the `.md`
from it — rejected because hand-writing JSON prose is miserable and the `.md` is nicer
to review in git. **Open for your call (§11).**

---

## 7. Update mechanism

> Superseded by §8.8: new and changed paths are fetched without asking; there is no
> "Week N available" step.

1. Content JSON is hosted at a stable URL — the same host as the PWA (GitHub Pages /
   Vercel / Netlify), so no CORS or extra infra.
2. On launch (and on pull-to-refresh), the app fetches `curriculum.json`.
3. It compares against the cached manifest:
   - **New week** (`available: true`, not seen before) → "✨ Week N available" card on
     the map with a **Load week** button. Tapping it downloads + caches that week.
   - **Changed existing week** (different `contentHash` — e.g. I fixed a Day 3 typo) →
     silently refreshes that week's cache, preserving your progress (keyed by day id).
4. Downloaded weeks live in the Cache API / IndexedDB → full offline use afterward.
5. `schemaVersion` guards against an app too old to parse new content (prompts a
   refresh of the app shell itself, which the service worker handles).

**Weekly cadence for me:** write next week's `.md` + `.quiz.yaml` → run the build
script → commit/push → the hosted content updates → your app shows "Week N available."
No app rebuild, no redeploy of the shell for content-only changes.

---

## 8. Chat with the mentor (built 2026-09-02)

Goal: ask the mentor a quick question *in context* without leaving the app —
"why does TIME_WAIT exist again?" while sitting on Day 3.

**Behaviour as built**
- A **Mentor** tab, fifth in the bar.
- Every message carries a system prompt = the mentor persona distilled from
  `CLAUDE.md` (tone, calibration to the learner's baseline, and the prime directive:
  *never write the milestone implementation; answer "why" freely; guiding questions
  when the learner is stuck*) **plus** the current day's title, theory and task, and the titles
  of the days still ahead so it can't get in front of the curriculum.
- Responses stream token by token. One thread per day, stored locally, resumed on
  return.
- The in-app mentor obeys the same prime directive as the CLI, by construction of its
  system prompt. This is a feature: the app cannot become a cheat button.

**Transport**
- Direct client → provider API with a key pasted into Settings, stored on-device only
  and never included in the synced payload. Both endpoints' CORS preflights were
  verified before the code was written: Anthropic allows the
  `anthropic-dangerous-direct-browser-access` opt-in header, and Google echoes the
  origin and accepts the key in `x-goog-api-key` — which keeps it out of the URL, and
  therefore out of anything that logs URLs.
- No proxy, no serverless function. `src/lib/mentor.ts` is two `fetch` calls behind
  one interface; swapping in a proxy later is a change to that file alone.

### 8.0 Two providers, because the bills are different

Shipping only Anthropic was a design mistake, and it surfaced the moment the key was
pasted in: **the Anthropic API is prepaid and entirely separate from a Claude
subscription.** "Get a key" is not sufficient instruction — the account needs credit,
and a Max subscription grants none. For a tab whose job is answering "why is it like
this" three times a session, a paywall is a bad trade.

So the mentor is provider-agnostic, with **Gemini as the default**:

| | Gemini | Claude |
|---|---|---|
| Cost | Free tier — rate-limited, not metered. No card. | Prepaid credits, ~½–2¢ a question. |
| Getting a key | AI Studio, sign in with Google, one tap. | Console, plus a top-up. |
| Answer quality | Good enough for concept questions. | Better, particularly on C++ specifics. |

Both share the persona, the prime directive, the day context, the history window and
the markdown rendering. What differs is genuinely only the wire format — Gemini calls
the assistant `model`, puts the system prompt in `systemInstruction`, wraps text in
`parts[]`, and hides streamed tokens in `candidates[0].content.parts[].text`. Every one
of those differences fails as a runtime 400 rather than a type error, which is why
`scripts/test-mentor.mjs` asserts the shape of both requests rather than trusting them.

**Gemini's model list is fetched, not hardcoded.** Google retires and renames models
often enough that a list pinned today 404s within a year, and that failure reaches the
user as "model not available" with no route to one that is. On key save the app calls
`ListModels`, keeps the entries that support `generateContent`, drops embeddings and
image/audio models, sorts Flash first (its free-tier limits are the generous ones), and
**heals the stored choice if it is no longer offered**. `Settings.mentorModel` is
therefore a plain `string`, not a union — the type system should not be more confident
about a model name than Google is.

### 8.1 Security consequence, handled

Model output is rendered as markdown through `{@html}`, in a page whose IndexedDB
holds a GitHub token and an Anthropic key. `src/lib/markdown.ts` therefore escapes raw
HTML from *every* source and filters link and image hrefs to navigational schemes —
one always-safe path rather than a `trusted` flag someone eventually forgets to pass.
`scripts/test-markdown.mjs` asserts it against the obvious payloads and against the
lesson formatting that has to keep working.

## 8.5 Progress sync (built 2026-09-02)

Exporting JSON by hand is the kind of friction that quietly ends a daily habit. The
constraint: free, no server, and nothing new to run.

**Chosen: a secret GitHub Gist**, written directly from the phone.

- `api.github.com` sends `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` (verified), so a static page
  can `PATCH` it with no proxy.
- Auth is a **fine-grained PAT with one permission: Gists, read and write**. It cannot
  read a repo, push code, or open an issue, and it's revocable from one page. That's
  the trade for having no backend: a narrow credential on the device instead of a
  broad one on a machine you'd have to keep running.
- The gist is secret, versioned, and diffable — and it's readable from the laptop,
  so a session there can see what happened on the phone.

**Rejected**

- *Telegram Bot API.* Also CORS-open, but a bot cannot read its own chat history, so
  "restore onto a wiped phone" has no clean path (the pinned-message trick caps at
  4096 characters and is fragile). The 4 GB of Saved Messages belongs to the user
  account, which bots can't touch. And a bot token is a far broader capability than
  gists-only.
- *Committing `progress.json` to this repo.* Needs `contents: write` — a much wider
  token — and turns a learning log into commit-history noise.
- *A third-party free tier.* Another account, another expiry, dead in two years.

**Merge, not last-write-wins.** There's no server to arbitrate, so `src/lib/merge.ts`
is a pure function both devices would compute identically. Every field takes the
more-advanced of the two values or keeps both; opening the laptop can never erase a
session done on the phone that morning. Specifics worth knowing:

- **XP is derived from the day records, not merged.** An accumulator can't merge:
  summing double-counts a shared session, maxing loses one. The days are the ledger.
- **The streak is derived from the day records too, not chosen.** It used to be: the
  device that acted most recently won the count. That broke the ordinary case — a day
  finished on the phone yesterday, then one on the laptop today *before* the laptop had
  pulled — because the laptop computed 1 from its own stale counter, and "most recent
  wins" kept the 1 for good. Each day's `completedAt` merges exactly (earliest wins), so
  `deriveStreak` replays the streak rules over those dates instead, freezes included. A
  phone in a drawer still can't resurrect a broken run: the gap is in the dates, whoever
  holds them. `longest` takes the max, because that's what a high-water mark means.
- **Settings and `loadedWeeks` stay local.** Syncing theme would flip the laptop when
  someone switches the phone to dark at night; syncing `loadedWeeks` would convince a fresh
  install it already holds content it hasn't downloaded.
- **Two different notes on the same day are both kept**, separated by a rule. Dropping
  one silently is the worst outcome available.
- **Reset switches sync off** rather than pushing an empty record over the backup a
  few seconds later. Reconnecting afterwards pulls it back, which makes deleting the
  gist the deliberate act it ought to be.

Sync runs on launch, on returning to the foreground, and a few seconds after any
change; a pending push is flushed when the app is backgrounded, which on iOS is the
last moment it's reliably allowed to run. `scripts/test-merge.mjs` covers it.

The JSON export in §3.5 stays. It's the copy that doesn't depend on GitHub.

## 8.6 The review deck (built 2026-09-07)

A day you finished is treated as finished forever, and memory does not honour that
assumption. Day 1 rots while you are on Day 6 and nothing ever asks about it again.

**Cards are derived, not authored.** Every finished day already carries the material:
five quiz questions with an explanation on every option, a `teachBack` prompt, and the
theory itself. So the deck is built from content plus progress at read time rather than
stored — a lesson that gains a question gains a card, and a card whose id no longer
exists simply stops being dealt. Three kinds:

| Kind | Source | Needs the mentor |
|---|---|---|
| `quiz` | a question you already answered, replayed from the bank | no — works offline |
| `explain` | the day's `teachBack`, graded like the session's fourth step | yes |
| `forge` | a challenge written fresh from that day's theory | yes |

The forged ones are the point: a question you have provably never seen, so it cannot be
answered from recognition. When there is no key or no signal the deck falls back to the
quiz cards, which is why those stay in it at all.

**Scheduling is SM-2 with the schedule deliberately blurred.** 1 day, 3 days, then
multiply by ease; a miss drops straight back to one day and costs ease. Every interval
is then scattered by up to 20%. Without that, a day's five cards come due on the same
morning forever — you would answer five questions about Day 2 in a row, recognise the
batch rather than the material, and get nothing on the days between. The jitter frays
batches apart within a couple of cycles.

**Randomness on top of the schedule.** Due cards are dealt shuffled rather than
oldest-first; 15% of the time a card that is *not* due is spliced in anyway; and on a
day when nothing is due at all there is a 20% chance of being asked something regardless.
The schedule decides what you owe, not what you can be asked.

**Delivery: the app ambushes you.** Once a day at most, opening the app leads with a
card instead of the lesson. There is no scheduled local notification because there is
no such thing for a PWA — Notification Triggers is a Chromium experiment that never
shipped — and no push, because push needs something running to send it. The second
surface is the gap this feature was actually asked for: when theory and quiz are done
but the task is parked waiting for a compiler you do not have on you, the phone offers
review instead of nothing. It never gates a new day; a review system you cannot walk
away from is one you start avoiding.

**The mentor is reachable from a card, but only after you answer it.** Before that it
is simply the answer key, and a card you looked up has measured nothing. Afterwards is
the most useful moment in the deck — you have just found out you were wrong — so the
sheet opens scoped to *that card's* day rather than the current one, and its openers
quote the option you actually picked back at you: "where does that reasoning break" is
a better question than "why is B right". The thread it lands in is that day's, so the
conversation is there under Mentor later.

*Still to build:* real push, sent by a scheduled GitHub Action reading the subscription
out of the sync gist. No new infrastructure — Actions and the gist already exist — but
it needs VAPID keys as repo secrets, and on iOS only reaches a PWA added to the Home
Screen.

## 8.7 Practice on demand, and Parsons cards (built 2026-09-07)

The deck answered "what have I forgotten". It had no answer for "I have a free hour,
the next day is locked, and I don't want to burn tomorrow's lesson to fill the time" —
it dead-ended on *Deck's clear*. Two additions, both picked off the evidence rather
than off intuition.

**Parsons cards.** A real code block from that day's own theory, shuffled; you tap the
lines back into order. The evidence for this is unusually good: across randomised
comparisons, solving Parsons problems produced learning gains equal to writing the
equivalent code while taking significantly less time, with no significant difference in
retention a week later, and the adaptive variants came out ahead of code-writing
outright (Ericson et al.). What makes it the right fit *here* is mechanical rather than
pedagogical: it needs no compiler and no typing, so it is the only form of genuine code
practice that survives a phone on a train — which is exactly the situation that was
going to waste.

Blocks come from the lesson markdown the app already ships, so these cards work with no
key and no signal. Blocks are filtered to 3–12 lines (two lines is not a puzzle, twelve
is a scrolling exercise) and any block with a repeated line is dropped, because that has
more than one correct order and marking one of them wrong would be a lie. Fences are
paired by scanning line by line: the first version used one regex, which cheerfully
paired a *closing* fence with the next *opening* one and dealt a card made of three
sentences and a heading.

*Not yet done:* distractor lines, which is the variant most of the efficiency evidence
actually tested, and indentation as a second dimension.

**Practice on demand.** *Deck's clear* now offers to keep going, and Today offers it
whenever the deck is non-empty rather than only when something is due. Practice deals
from the whole deck, ignoring due dates.

The scheduling rule that makes this safe: **answering early can hurt your schedule but
not flatter it.** A correct answer on a card that wasn't due records the attempt and
leaves the interval alone; a miss still pulls the card all the way back. You chose the
card and it was still fresh, so getting it right is weak evidence — but failing it is
strong evidence whenever it happens. Without that asymmetry, an idle evening of
cramming would push everything months out and quietly hollow the deck.

### Why these, and what the app already had

| Finding | Where it lives |
|---|---|
| Retrieval practice and distributed practice are the two highest-utility techniques reviewed (Dunlosky et al. 2013) | the deck itself |
| Spacing, interleaving and retrieval are "desirable difficulties" — they feel worse and work better (Bjork) | jittered intervals, shuffled dealing |
| Parsons problems: equal learning to code-writing, less time (Ericson et al.) | Parsons cards |
| Problem-solving *before* instruction beats instruction-first for conceptual understanding and transfer, over 166 comparisons (Sinha & Kapur 2021) | not yet built — see below |
| Predict-before-run (PRIMM) grounds code comprehension | partly, via forged predict-the-output challenges |
| Faded worked examples: learners learn most about the steps that were faded (Renkl) | not yet built |

**The productive-failure idea worth building next.** The meta-analysis is about
attempting a problem *before* being taught the method. The app currently forbids
exactly that: tomorrow's task is locked behind tomorrow's theory. Letting someone
attempt the *task* of a locked day without unlocking its *theory* is both what the
evidence supports and what was actually asked for — the struggle without the spoiler.

## 8.8 Tracks, not weeks (2026-10-01)

Asked for directly: no weeks, a track per subject, a new lesson every day, and more
material written whenever it runs short. The week had been doing three jobs, and each
went somewhere better:

- **A unit of content.** The build now joins every topic of a track, in directory order,
  into one path (`content/weeks/track-<t>.json`, keeping the `Week` shape so an install
  that hasn't updated can still read it). Topics (`milestones/<m>/lessons/topic.yaml`)
  are only how the source is organised; on the path they are quiet dividers. Day numbers
  keep counting up through a track, and the build fails if a topic restarts them.
- **A unit of download.** Gone. Any path that is new or whose hash changed is fetched on
  launch, and bundles the manifest no longer lists — the old per-week ones — are deleted,
  so a day can never show up twice. Today says "N new days" once, after they arrive.
- **A finish line.** "Week clear" read as *you're done* when it meant *nothing more is
  written yet*. Now running out is a normal, visible state: at two written days left Today
  says so, and at zero it says "All caught up" with a button that copies a ready-made
  request for more (track, last day finished, what is planned next). The plan itself is
  `milestones/tracks.yaml` → `next:`, shown at the end of the map as "Coming up".

The first device to update showed only the first old week on the map. The new build had
read a *stale* content list (GitHub Pages' edge keeps files for up to ten minutes after a
deploy, and `cache: 'no-cache'` only revalidates against the edge), so it saw nothing to
migrate. Two guards since: the list is fetched with a query string the edge has never
seen (the service worker ignores it for its offline copy), and any old per-week bundles
still held are joined into one path on the client, so the whole track shows either way.

Nothing keyed by week moved, because almost nothing was: progress, review cards, chat
threads, XP and the streak are all keyed by day id. The exceptions were the session URL
(an old `/session/week-sql-01/...` link still opens the day, and the address is rewritten
to its track) and one badge, "Raw Sockets, Done", which now checks the topic rather than
the week and keeps its old id because earned badges are stored under it. The mentor and
examiner are told track, topic and day, and only the next few days rather than every day
to the end of a path that grows on request.

## 8.9 Write the query (2026-10-01)

Reorder cards (§8.7) train the order of lines, not the ability to produce them, and for SQL
the thing worth drilling is the syntax. So the deck has a sixth card kind, `write`: the tables,
the result you are aiming at, and an editor.

- **Judged by running it.** The answer is executed in PGlite — the real PostgreSQL compiled to
  WebAssembly, about 5 MB over the wire — and its rows are compared with the reference
  solution's (`writecheck.ts`). Column names are ignored, row order only when the reference sorts
  at the top level, and numbers compare by value (`120.00` = `120`, but `0.30000000000000004` is
  not `0.3`). Nothing is compared as text, so every correct spelling passes, and no model or
  network is involved.
- **The target is computed, not authored.** The card file holds `setup` and `solution`; the
  deck runs the solution to draw the target and reads the tables' columns and rows from the
  engine, so what is on screen can never disagree with the reference.
- **The engine cannot be interrupted.** PGlite has no timer to deliver a cancel, so
  `statement_timeout` does nothing and an unterminated `WITH RECURSIVE` never returns. It runs in
  a worker (`sqlrun.worker.ts`) and a query unfinished after 6 s gets the worker terminated and
  replaced; the learner is told it ran too long. Starting is bounded too (90 s), the engine is
  released when the deck is left, and a card that cannot be set up is put aside, never graded.
- **A clean database per run.** Each run rolls back, resets settings, drops every schema, pins
  the time zone to UTC and rebuilds the card's tables, so a `COMMIT`, a stray schema or an
  aborted transaction cannot reach the next card.
- **Caching.** The engine's files are kept out of the install-time precache (it stays at ~480 KiB)
  and cached on first use, so a phone that never reaches a write card never pays for it, and
  one that has works with no network.
- **Grading.** The first run counts: a wrong answer, an error, a hint or "show answer" is a
  miss, a clean first run is a pass, and fixing it afterwards is free.

Verified in three places: `test-write.mjs` (comparison rules; every shipped card against the
engine; isolation between runs; the engine's answers against a real PostgreSQL 16's),
`tools/check-write-cards.py` (every solution on a real server) and Chromium (a wrong answer,
a syntax error, a runaway query, a different correct spelling, offline).

### 8.9a Go and C++: judged by shape

The same card kind for the other two tracks, without an engine — because there is no honest one.
I built and rejected **yaegi** (a Go interpreter in WebAssembly): against a corpus of the
lesson's own programs it got `defer` argument evaluation, the per-iteration loop variable,
`%T`, `errors.As`, `recover` and `min` wrong, and a card that marks a correct answer wrong
because the interpreter disagrees with `go` teaches the wrong thing. A C++ compiler in the browser
is tens of megabytes and the sockets lessons could not run in it anyway.

So `shapecheck.ts` judges *shape*: tokenize (comments and whitespace gone), normalise (C++
`std::`, a leading `::`, `struct` before a name), check the brackets balance, then require each
thing the card names as a token pattern. Patterns bind identifiers (`$name`), allow equally right
spellings (`\( a \| b \)`), and a pattern starting with a name never matches the tail of
`x.name` / `ns::name`. A requirement can be an ordered `then` list; `forbids` are the plausible
wrong answers. After a check the learner sees each requirement ticked or crossed, in words that
describe it. The first check counts for the schedule, exactly as for SQL.

What makes shape trustworthy is the authoring check, not the judge: `scripts/check-shape-cards.mjs`
runs every reference answer, alternative and wrong example through the real `go`/`g++` in a
harness (C++ ones on real sockets), then mutation-tests the patterns. Verified: 53 cards (27 Go,
26 C++), 2,451 mutants, no false accepts; `test-shape.mjs` covers the judge itself; Chromium
covers dealing, a wrong check, a right one, hint and give-up.

## 8.10 Practice rounds: a concept stays until it lands (2026-10-02)

The path used to introduce one concept per day, and the review deck had about a dozen
fixed cards per day to revise it with — so after two days the whole deck was ~25 cards and
"Keep practising" cycled them until the answers were remembered rather than understood. The
fix changes the unit from *a day* to *a concept*:

- **Learn day, then practice days.** After a lesson, Today offers a practice round on it
  instead of the next lesson (`app.practising`: the latest finished lesson, when it has a
  bank that has not landed). A round (`practice.ts`) is 10 items from the day's practice
  bank, ~70% write cards and the rest drill steps spaced between them, fresh items first.
- **Mastery opens the next lesson.** A round scoring ≥80% right first time (≥6 items) sets
  `landedAt`. "Move on anyway" sets `movedOn` — the next lesson opens, the bank stays.
  Only the latest lesson gates; banks written later for old days are offered, not imposed.
- **First attempts only.** `PracticeState.first` records each item's first-ever result;
  later attempts never overwrite it, two devices merge with the miss winning a
  disagreement, and rounds union by timestamp. A finished round counts for the streak
  (`deriveStreak` reads rounds as well as completed days).
- **The deck grows instead of cycling.** Practice items a round has dealt become review
  cards (`cardsFor`), as do a day's answered drill steps (new card kind `drill`). Practice
  mode in the deck no longer restarts from the top when every card has been seen; it says
  so and points at the practice set.
- **Honest cards.** SQL write cards may carry `forbids` (regexes, for cards about how a
  query is written) and `bad` examples; `tools/check-write-cards.py` proves the reference
  passes and every bad example fails on PostgreSQL 16, and `test-write.mjs` compares the
  browser engine's answers with PG16's card by card.

First banks: indexes (21 write + 12 drill) and clause order (19 write + 12 drill). Verified:
`test-practice.mjs`, the checker (78 SQL cards, 84 bad examples proven wrong), PGlite vs
PG16 agreement, and Chromium (a landing round, a non-landing round, Today before and after).

## 8.11 A deck that pays attention (2026-10-06)

Two complaints about review: it didn't react to mistakes, and familiar cards were answered by
shape ("I just remember the answer and don't read the question"). `focus.ts` answers both.

- **Themes.** Items carry an optional `tag` (the one idea tested); the fallback is the day.
  `heatMap` derives which themes are hot from the stored schedule alone (a card whose last
  answer was a miss, decaying with a four-day half-life), so nothing new is stored or synced.
- **Follow-ups.** `pickFollowUps` scores same-theme (+3), a different kind of card from the miss
  and from the previous pick (+1 each), same day (+1), plus a little noise; cards from other
  days and graded conversation cards are never picked. The pool is the deck plus practice-bank
  items no round has dealt, so a miss reaches for questions he has never seen. With the mentor
  reachable the second follow-up is written by the model about that exact miss
  (`ForgeTarget`: the miss with its key and his answer, what has been asked this sitting, an
  explicit "different angle, don't just change the numbers"). A practice-bank item's first
  sight counts as its first attempt wherever it was dealt.
- **Reflex.** Options are shown in a fresh random order every time, never the authored one.
  `isReflex`: faster than 35% of the question's reading time (240 ms/word, 1.2 s floor).
  `ReviewCard.reflex` counts consecutive right reflexes; at two (`isWorn`) the card is replaced
  in the deal by a model-written question on the same idea (or a sibling), and the substitute's
  result is credited to the worn card (right: it advances; wrong: it was not known after all).
- **Honest about its limits.** Speed is a proxy for not reading, so it can only change the
  question, never mark an answer wrong; a fast reader will occasionally see a fresh angle early,
  which costs nothing. Verified: `test-focus.mjs` (heat, cooling, follow-up choice, weighting,
  reflex thresholds, permutations, schedule counter) and Chromium (a miss pulling in a
  same-theme card and a forged question carrying the miss; two fast answers retiring a card
  into a fresh angle; option order differing between sittings).

## 9. Offline & local storage

- **Content cache:** Cache API / IndexedDB — loaded weeks fully offline.
- **Progress store:** local (IndexedDB) — current week/day, per-day state (theory
  read, quiz answers + score, task status, notes), streak (`lastActiveDate`, `count`,
  freezes), XP, badges, settings.
- **No server sync** (single device). Backup via Settings → export/import a progress
  JSON. Nice touch: export a day's note pre-formatted to paste into `PROGRESS.md` on
  the laptop.
- **Service worker** caches the app shell → instant launch, works offline, updates the
  shell when a new app version ships.

---

## 10. Tech stack (my recommendation — object if you want)

- **Svelte + Vite + `vite-plugin-pwa`.** Tiny runtime → fast on a phone, first-class
  PWA support, low ceremony. (You're a C++ dev, not a web dev — I optimized for *me*
  maintaining it cleanly and the bundle staying small, over framework familiarity.)
- **Markdown rendering:** a small bundled renderer; **Shiki or highlight.js** for C++
  syntax highlighting, bundled for offline.
- **Storage:** `idb` (thin IndexedDB wrapper) + localStorage for trivial flags.
- **Hosting:** GitHub Pages or Vercel — free, HTTPS (required for PWA install), content
  + shell same origin.
- **No backend** for v1. Chat (v2) is client-direct as in §8.

If you'd rather it be React (more transferable if you ever poke at it), say so — it's a
clean swap at this stage.

---

## 11. Decisions (settled 2026-09-01, extended 2026-09-02)

1. **Content authoring** — two files per day, `.md` + `.quiz.yaml`, compiled to week
   JSON by `app/scripts/build-content.mjs`. The answer key stays out of the file he'd
   naturally open mid-lesson. Adopted; `week.yaml` was added alongside them to carry
   the week roster so unwritten days can still appear on the map as locked steps.
2. **Tech stack** — Svelte 5 + Vite + `vite-plugin-pwa`. No preference expressed, so
   the §10 recommendation stands: small runtime, and I'm the one maintaining it.
3. **Gamification** — as designed. Streak with earned freezes, 3-segment day ring,
   week bar, XP, badges in the mentor's voice, re-drillable past quizzes.
4. **Peek-ahead** — days ahead locked by default, with an explicit "Let me jump ahead"
   toggle on the map and in Settings. Gentle, not a nanny.
5. **v1 scope** — chat held to v2. Everything in §3.1–3.5 is in and built.
6. **Sync transport (2026-09-02)** — GitHub gist over Telegram, for the reasons in
   §8.5. He raised Telegram explicitly; the blocker is that bots can't read their own
   history, which makes restore-after-wipe unworkable.
7. **Mentor provider (2026-09-02)** — Gemini's free tier is the default; Anthropic is
   kept as a switch rather than removed, since it answers better once an account has
   credit. Driven by a real dead end: a valid Anthropic key with a $0 balance, and app
   copy that said "get a key" without saying "and prepay it".
8. **Quiz option order (2026-09-02)** — decided by the build, not the author. Writing
   the right answer first is the natural way to author a key, and it made every
   correct answer option A. `build-content.mjs` now shuffles deterministically per
   question, re-salting if a whole day lands its answers in the same slot.

### Where the build knowingly departs from this doc

- **Accent colour.** §5 wanted one accent for both primary actions and the flame. Built
  with two: violet for actions, orange kept for the flame only. An orange CTA sat a
  hair away from the wrong-answer red, and a quiz app cannot afford that confusion.
- **Week 1 is 8 days, not 7.** The §6.1 example said 7; milestone 01 actually has
  eight sessions. The content follows the milestone.
- **Locked days show their teaser**, with a single note at the foot of the week
  explaining they're not written yet — rather than stamping "Not written yet" on
  every row.
- **Streak freezes cap at 2** and are earned every 7th day. §4 said "earn one every 7
  days" without a ceiling; uncapped, a long run banks enough freezes to make the
  streak meaningless.
- **The mentor is two providers, not one.** §8 specified Anthropic only. See §8.0 —
  the free tier is what makes the tab usable without a billing decision first.
- **The Mentor tab is always visible**, not revealed once a key is set as §8 said. A
  feature you have to already know about to find is a feature nobody finds; the tab
  shows a setup card explaining what it does, what it refuses to do, and that it's the
  one part of the app that costs money.
- **Test files exist** (`app/scripts/test-*.mjs`, `npm test`). The streak rules
  are the one piece of logic here subtle enough — freezes, gaps, DST-proof date maths
  — to fail silently and only be noticed by losing a real 40-day run. Node's own
  runner, no framework, no new dependencies. Merge and markdown-escaping joined it in
  v2 for the same reason: both fail silently and both fail expensively. It is not a
  general testing setup, and it does not pre-empt milestone 09.

## 12. Build plan

- **v0** — this design doc. ✅
- **v1** — core PWA: Today, session player (theory/quiz/task), week map, progress +
  streak + XP + badges, update mechanism, offline, both themes, installable. ✅ built
  2026-09-01. Week 1 ships with Day 1 written and Days 2–8 rostered as locked steps —
  lessons stay written one at a time, calibrated on how the last one went, per
  `README.md`.
- **v2** — mentor chat (§8, both providers) and progress sync (§8.5). ✅ built
  2026-09-02. ← we are here
- **v3 (optional)** — richer spaced-repetition review, more badges, note→PROGRESS.md
  export polish.
