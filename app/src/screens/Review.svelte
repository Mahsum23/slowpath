  /**
   * The review deck: old material, dealt back at you.
   *
   * Five kinds of card, deliberately mixed so a session never settles into a rhythm.
   * A write card makes you type something from memory. A SQL one is run in a PostgreSQL
   * on this device and judged by the rows it returns; a Go or C++ one cannot be run in a
   * browser, so it is judged by shape (shapecheck.ts) — and its card file was checked
   * against the real compiler before it shipped.
   * A quiz card is one you already answered weeks ago, replayed from the stored bank —
   * it needs no network and no key, which is what keeps the deck usable on a train. A
   * teach-back card asks you to explain a mechanism and is graded. A forged card is
   * written fresh by the model from that day's material, so it is one you have provably
   * never seen; those are the ones that catch you.
   *
   * Nothing here is a gate. You can walk away mid-card and the ones you cleared stay
   * cleared, because a review system you can't quit is one you start avoiding.
