/**
 * Spaced repetition, with the schedule deliberately blurred.
 *
 * The problem this solves is not "did you do today's lesson" — that part already works.
 * It's that Day 1 quietly rots while you're on Day 6, and nothing in the app ever asks
 * you about it again. A day you finished is treated as finished forever, which is the
 * one assumption memory does not honour.
 *
 * So every finished day leaves cards behind, and they come back on a widening interval:
 * a day, then a few, then a week, then a fortnight. Get one wrong and it drops back to
 * the start, because a fact you just failed to recall is not a fact you know.
 *
 * **Why the jitter.** A clean doubling schedule makes every card in a day's batch come
 * due on the same morning forever — you'd answer six questions about Day 2 in a row,
 * recognise the batch rather than the material, and get a pile of nothing on the days
 * between. Every interval here is scattered by up to 20%, so batches fray apart within
 * a couple of cycles and the deck arrives as a trickle instead of a lump. It also means
 * you genuinely cannot predict which day you're about to be asked about, which is the
 * difference between recall and recognition.
 *
 * Everything here is pure and takes its randomness as an argument, because a scheduler
 * you can't run twice with the same result is a scheduler you can't test.
