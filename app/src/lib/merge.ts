/**
 * Merging two progress records — the phone's and whatever the cloud last saw.
 *
 * There is no server to arbitrate, so this has to be a pure function that both sides
 * would compute identically, and it has to be safe to run repeatedly. The governing
 * rule is **never lose a fact**: every field either takes the more-advanced of the two
 * values or keeps both. Last-write-wins is deliberately not used for anything except
 * settings, because "I opened the laptop" should not be able to erase a session.
 *
 * The one field that can't be merged that way is the streak, which is history the
 * records no longer contain — see mergeStreak.
